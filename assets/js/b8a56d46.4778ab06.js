However, ceramic currently offers no incentivization layer to support the lifecycle of a singular event stream.  Indeed, until uptime and availiability guarantees are made available, streams will mostly remain unilaterally hosted, needlessly duplicated, and never uniquely exposable as a service.  Sintered Ceramic changes this.  By utilizing EigenLayer AVS we enable agents or networks of agents to provide ceramic streams as a service with cryptographic incentives instead of trust and reputation.  Streams can now be offered as a service, and consumers can attain a degree of confidance that their composition of streams remains available and up-to-date.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
