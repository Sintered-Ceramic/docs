Uptime and availability guarantees for Ceramic Streams.  Compose external streams with confidance or provide streams as a service.  Built with Ceramic and Eigenlayer AVS

## About

Ceramic Network illustrates a vision of a mesh of decentralized event streams, composed together to form ecosystems of dapps.  However, Ceramic networks offers no incentivization layer regarding the lifecycle of a stream.  They may be composable, but if you choose to interweave external streams you are at mercy to their infrastructure limitations and personal prerogatives.  To materialize the dream of ceramic, sintered ceramic utilizes EigenLayer AVS to provide an incentiviation layer for stream providers to provide robust, available and active streams.  Enabling developers to compose with streams without inheriting the infrastructure or duplication cost of such a stream.
